Phaser 3 FAQ
============

<https://github.com/samme/phaser3-faq/wiki>

There is [another excellent FAQ](https://github.com/phaser-discord/community/blob/master/FAQ.md). I wanted to try a wiki format to see if people like to contribute this way.

Goals
-----

- It's **one** page of **brief** answers to common questions
- It helps readers find the next point to explore complex topics
- It complements the existing guides, tutorials, and docs
- It's not a list of every Phaser resource that exists
